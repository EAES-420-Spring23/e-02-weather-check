In this mini analysis we work with the data used in the FiveThirtyEight story titled ["Where People Go to Check the Weather"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weather-forecast-news-app-habits/).
The Github source for the data and variables descriptions are [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/weather-check).

Your task is to fill in the blanks denoted by `___` (blank) in the main text and in the code chunks.

To allow you to knit the document before you have filled in the `___` (blanks), I have used `#` to "comment-out" some lines and chunks of code.

## Data and packages

We start with loading the packages we'll use.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```

The dataset contains Survey Monkey Poll results from April 6 to April 10, 2015, on where `r nrow(weather_check)` people go to check the weather forecast.
Only `r sum(weather_check$ck_weather == TRUE)/nrow(weather_check)*100`% of respondents checked the weather daily.

```{r}
weather_check_daily <- weather_check %>% 
  filter(ck_weather == TRUE)
```

There are `___` respondents who check the weather daily.

The `weather_check` variables we'll focus on are the following:

-   `weather_source`: One of "The Weather Channel", "Local TV News", "Radio weather", "Internet search", "The default weather app on your phone", "Newsletter", "Newspaper", "A specific website or app (please provide the answer)"

*Notice that if the last option "A specific website or app" is selected, then the respondent must provide a written answer which gets saved in* `weather_source_site`

-   `age`: Age range of respondent (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+)

-   `hhold_income`: Response to "How much total combined money did all members of your household earn last year?"

And we'll also use the `region` and `female` variable for **grouping**.

## Analysis

Let's take a look at the different `weather_source` responses, and how frequently each of them appeared:

```{r message = FALSE}
weather_check_daily %>%
  group_by(weather_source) %>%
  summarise(weather_source_count = n()) 
```

Next, let's take a look at the different `weather_source_site` responses (which site respondents used if they used "a specific website or app").
Once you complete and run the code chunk below, what do you notice about the written responses that relates to the goals of this course?
(Hint: Are these data responses in a standard format?)

```{r message = FALSE}
# weather_check_daily %>%
#   group_by(___) %>%
#   summarise(weather_source_count = n())
```

Next, we might wonder how the `weather_source` varies with `age` range of the respondent:

```{r}
# weather_check_daily %>%
#   group_by(___, ___) %>%
#   summarise(weather_source_count = n())
```

Notice that creating these count summaries of the data is fast, and can be done with just one or two lines of code!

Next, we might wonder how the `weather_source` varies with `hhold_income` range of the respondent:

```{r}
# weather_check_daily %>%
#   group_by(___, ___) %>%
#   summarise(weather_source_count = n())
```

There are `___` combinations of responses here so it's hard to see which combinations are most frequent.

We can arrange the responses from most frequent to least frequent using:

```{r}
# weather_check_daily %>%
#   group_by(___, ___) %>%
#   summarise(weather_source_count = n()) %>% 
#   arrange(desc(___))
```

You might also ask whether use of a particular weather source varies between male and female respondents.

First, let's assign the frequency data (using `<-`) we need as a new object called `weather_check_female_counts`:

```{r message = FALSE}
weather_check_female_counts <- weather_check_daily %>%
  group_by(female, weather_source) %>%
  summarise(weather_source_count = n())
```

Next, let's pass the new data object to a the `ggplot` plotting function: Remove the `#`s (i.e. uncomment the code) and complete the code chunk below:

```{r warning = FALSE}
# ggplot(data = ___, 
#        mapping = aes(x = weather_source, y = weather_source_count, color = female)) +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(title = "Weather source vs. respondent female",
#        x = "Weather source",
#        y = "___",
#        color = "Female") +
#   coord_flip()
```

What about patterns with age?

First, we the code chunk below will create the object `weather_check_age_counts`, which summarizes the `weather_source` by the `age` grouping variable.

```{r message = FALSE}
weather_check_age_counts <- weather_check_daily %>%
  group_by(age, weather_source) %>%
  summarise(weather_source_count = n())
```

Next, remove the `#`s (i.e. uncomment the code) and complete the code chunk below to visualize the data and assign colors based on `age` groups.

```{r warning = FALSE}
# ggplot(data = weather_check_age_counts,
#        mapping = aes(x = weather_source, y = weather_source_count, color = ___)) +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(title = "Weather source vs. age",
#        x = "Weather source",
#        y = "___",
#        color = "age") +
#   coord_flip()
```
